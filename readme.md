## Why Not Use Markdown?
1. **Shorter**, create strong text with a single asterisk: `*bold*`.
2. **Consistency**, Every expression of Gularen only perform one action, and there is no alternative syntax.
3. **Better order and default**, In the image expression, the URL is the first argument `![https://i.imgflip.com/7r6vdk.jpg]`. You don't even have to write the label.
4. **Comment**, Anything after `# ` (hash-space) in `now you see me # now you don't` will not be rendered.
5. **Secure**, You dont have to worry about inline HTML, because Gularen does not support inline HTML.

I drew most of my inspiration from AsciiDoc and Markdown, so there aren't any drastic changes to the syntax and structures.
